# Welcome to the ecg-kit wiki!

This toolbox is a collection of Matlab tools used, adapted or developed by me during my PhD. It has tools for reading, processing and presenting results, as you can see in the [documentation](http://ecg-kit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) or in these demos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJtkGhrqFw&list=PLlD2eDv5CIe9sA2atmnb-DX48FIRG46z7&index=1).

This kit also includes many open-source projects such as [WFDB Toolbox for MATLAB and Octave](http://physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/) from [Physionet](http://physionet.org/), [PRtools](http://prtools.org/), [Libra](https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/LIBRA), [export_fig](http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/export_fig) from [undocumented Matlab](http://undocumentedmatlab.com/), and many other open source scripts like kur, wavedet, some ECG parsers and others that have their proper references to the original projects.

You can say hello, ask for help or give us feedback in the [forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ecgkit-users). If you find any bug, please report it in the [issues](https://github.com/marianux/ecg-kit/issues) section.
