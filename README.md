# Welcome to the ecg-kit !

This toolbox is a collection of Matlab tools used, adapted or developed by me during my PhD and post-doc work in the [Besicos group of University of Zaragoza](http://diec.unizar.es/~laguna/personal/), Spain and the [National Technological University](http://www.electron.frba.utn.edu.ar/) of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The ECG-kit has tools for reading, processing and presenting results, as you can see in the [documentation](http://ecg-kit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) or in these demos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJtkGhrqFw&list=PLlD2eDv5CIe9sA2atmnb-DX48FIRG46z7&index=1).

The main feature of the this toolbox is the possibility to use a lot of the most popular algorithms for ECG processing, such as:

* Algorithms from Physionet's [WFDB software package](http://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml)
* QRS detectors, such as gqrs, wqrs, ecgpuwave, Pan & Tompkins, [EP limited](http://www.eplimited.com/confirmation.htm)
* [Wavedet ECG delinator](http://diec.unizar.es/~laguna/personal/publicaciones/wavedet_tbme04.pdf)
* [a2hbc heartbeat classifier](https://code.google.com/p/a2hbc/)
* And other scritps for inspecting, correcting and reporting all these results. 

with the same application programmer interface (API) directly in Matlab, from Windows, Linux and Mac.

This kit also includes many open-source projects such as [WFDB Toolbox for MATLAB and Octave](http://physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/) from [Physionet](http://physionet.org/), [PRtools](http://prtools.org/), [Libra](https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/LIBRA), [export_fig](http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/export_fig) from [undocumented Matlab](http://undocumentedmatlab.com/), and other open-source scripts that have their proper references to the original projects or authors.

You can say hello, ask for help or give us feedback in the [forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ecgkit-users). If you find any bug, please report it in the [issues](https://github.com/marianux/ecg-kit/issues) section.
