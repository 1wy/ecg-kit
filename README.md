This toolbox is a collection of Matlab tools used, adapted or developed by me during my PhD. It has tools for reading, processing and presenting results. Read the documentation for details.

This kit also includes some open-source projects like PRtools, Libra and export_fig, and many other open source scripts like kur, wavedet, some ECG parsers and others that have their proper references to the original projects.
