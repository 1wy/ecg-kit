Installation
------------

To install the kit unpack or checkout the kit to
'your\_installation\_folder' and type in Matlab

.. code:: 

    cd 'your_installation_folder'
    InstallECGkit()

Here you have a `Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJtkGhrqFw&list=PLlD2eDv5CIe9sA2atmnb-DX48FIRG46z7&index=1>`__ video
of a typical installation. You can try then the ``examples.m`` script in order to check the correct
installation in some included recordings:

.. code:: 

    examples()

or if you want to try in your own recordings:

.. code:: 

     examples('1/1', 'C:\Your_own_recordings\')

The use of this script is explained more in detail in the
:doc:`Examples <examples>` section.

Uninstallation is as easy as typing:

.. code:: 

    UnInstallECGkit()
